## The Basics (TL;DR)

Don't be a jerk. Don't steal our stuff. Don't sue us if you don't like our opinions. We're just people on the internet talking about things. If that sounds reasonable, welcome. If not, there's the door.

<!--more-->

## The Slightly Longer Version

Look, we grew up in the '80s and '90s when the internet was the Wild West and nobody had lawyers. But apparently, we need these now, so here we go.

## Use of This Site

You're free to browse, listen, read, and generally consume content here. That's literally why we made it. What you can't do:

- **Redistribute our podcast episodes** as if they're yours (they're not)
- **Scrape our entire site** with bots (rude)
- **Hack, exploit, or otherwise mess with** our infrastructure (seriously?)
- **Impersonate us** (why would you want to?)
- **Use our content for commercial purposes** without asking nicely first

We reserve the right to block access to anyone acting like it's 4chan circa 2007.

## Intellectual Property

### Our Content

Everything here—the podcast episodes, blog posts, artwork, terrible jokes—is ours unless otherwise noted. That means:

- **Copyright © [Year] [Your Name]**
- Licensed under [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) for non-commercial use
- Want to use our stuff commercially? Ask us. We're reasonable people (usually).

### Your Content

If you comment, email, or otherwise send us stuff:

- You still own it
- You're giving us permission to use it (we might read your email on the show)
- Don't send us anything illegal, defamatory, or just plain gross

## Podcast Content Disclaimer

Our opinions are our own. They're not:

- **Medical advice** (we're not doctors, and even if we were, we wouldn't be *your* doctor)
- **Legal advice** (obviously, see above)
- **Financial advice** (do we look like we know what a 401(k) is?)
- **Relationship advice** (have you *met* us?)

Basically, if you make life decisions based solely on our ramblings, that's on you.

## Guest Appearances

If you're a guest on our show:

- You retain rights to your own words and likeness
- You're giving us permission to edit, publish, and distribute the episode
- We'll credit you and link to your stuff
- If you later become famous and embarrassed, tough cookies—the internet is forever

## Affiliate Links & Sponsorships

Sometimes we link to products or services. Sometimes those links make us a few pennies. Sometimes companies pay us to talk about their stuff. We'll always tell you when that's happening because:

1. It's the law
2. We're not monsters

You're smart enough to make your own purchasing decisions.

## Privacy (See Our Privacy Policy)

We don't want your data. Seriously. We barely want our own data. See our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy/) for the full story.

## External Links

We link to other sites sometimes. We're not responsible for their content, practices, or weird pop-ups. Click at your own risk.

## Changes to These Terms

We might update these terms occasionally. When we do:

- We'll update the "Last Modified" date at the top
- Major changes will be announced on the podcast/blog
- Continued use = you're cool with the changes

If you're *not* cool with the changes, stop using the site. We'll miss you, but we'll survive.

## Limitation of Liability

**In plain English:** We're not liable for anything. Not for:

- Hurt feelings
- Bad advice you took seriously
- Technical issues
- Lost productivity from binge-listening
- Any other damages, real or imagined

**In legal-ese:** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THIS SITE.

## Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of [Your State/Country], because that's where we are. Any disputes will be settled like adults—preferably over coffee, but if necessary, in the courts of [Your Jurisdiction].

## Severability

If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the rest still applies. It's like when one person in the band quits—the show goes on.

## The "Don't Be a Jerk" Clause

This is the most important part: Just don't be a jerk. We're all trying to make it through this mess called life with some semblance of sanity. Be kind, be reasonable, and we'll all get along fine.
