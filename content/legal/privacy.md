## The Real Talk Version

We don't want your data. We grew up before surveillance capitalism was a thing, and honestly, we miss those days. This site collects the bare minimum to function, and we're not selling anything to anyone.

<!--more-->

## What We Collect (Spoiler: Not Much)

### Server Logs

Like every website since 1995, our server logs basic stuff:

- **IP address** (so we can send you the page)
- **Browser type** (in case something breaks)
- **Pages visited** (to see if anyone actually reads our stuff)
- **Referring URL** (how you found us)

This is standard internet plumbing. We don't correlate it, we don't analyze it for marketing, and we definitely don't sell it.

### Analytics (The Honest Kind)

We might use privacy-respecting analytics like [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) or [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/):

- **No cookies**
- **No personal data collection**
- **No tracking across sites**
- **Just simple counts** (like "47 people visited this page")

Why? Because we're curious if anyone's listening, not because we want to build a psychological profile of you.

### Newsletter (If You Subscribe)

If you sign up for our newsletter:

- We collect your **email address** (obviously)
- We use [Buttondown/Mailchimp/ConvertKit] to send emails
- You can unsubscribe anytime (no guilt trips)
- We don't share your email with anyone

### Comments (If We Enable Them)

We might use:

- **Utterances** (uses your GitHub account)
- **Giscus** (uses GitHub Discussions)
- **Waline** (self-hosted, minimal data)

None of these are tracking you across the web. They're just comment boxes.

### Podcast Players

When you play our podcast:

- **Spotify/Apple/YouTube** have their own privacy policies (not our problem)
- We don't get your personal data from them
- They might track you (take it up with Big Tech)

### RSS Feeds

RSS is beautiful because it's private. When you subscribe to our RSS feed:

- We don't know who you are
- We can't track you
- It's like the old internet

Please use RSS. We miss RSS.

## What We DON'T Collect

- **Your location** (we don't care where you are)
- **Your browsing history** (not our business)
- **Your social media profiles** (unless you comment with them)
- **Your purchasing behavior** (we're not selling anything anyway)
- **Anything from your microphone/camera** (what kind of operation do you think this is?)

## Cookies

We use minimal cookies, mostly for:

- **Remembering your theme preference** (dark mode FTW)
- **Newsletter signup forms** (if you use them)
- **Comment systems** (if enabled)

That's it. No advertising cookies. No tracking cookies. No cookie jar full of surveillance.

## How We Use Your Data

Very carefully, which is to say, barely at all:

1. **Server logs:** Debugging technical issues
2. **Analytics:** Understanding what content people like
3. **Newsletter emails:** Sending you podcast updates (only if you asked)
4. **Legal compliance:** If we're legally required (we hope it never comes to that)

We do NOT:

- Sell your data
- Share it with advertisers
- Use it for profiling
- Create shadow profiles
- Do anything creepy

## Third-Party Services

We use some third-party services that might collect data:

| Service | Purpose | Privacy Policy |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Hosting Provider | Serving the site | [Their Policy] |
| Newsletter Provider | Sending emails | [Their Policy] |
| Comment System | Enabling discussions | [Their Policy] |

These services have their own privacy policies. We chose them because they're relatively privacy-friendly, but we can't control what they do.

## Your Rights (Especially If You're In Europe)

Under GDPR (and similar laws), you have rights:

- **Access:** Ask what data we have (spoiler: probably nothing)
- **Correction:** Fix any incorrect data
- **Deletion:** Request we delete your data
- **Portability:** Get your data in a portable format
- **Objection:** Object to our processing

To exercise these rights, email us. We'll respond within 30 days (probably sooner, we're not that busy).

## Data Retention

We keep data for as long as necessary:

- **Server logs:** 30-90 days (then deleted)
- **Analytics:** Aggregated forever (it's just numbers)
- **Newsletter:** Until you unsubscribe
- **Comments:** Until you delete them

## Security

We take reasonable security measures:

- **HTTPS** (encrypted connections)
- **Updated software** (we patch things)
- **No shared passwords** (we're not amateurs)

But let's be real: Nothing on the internet is 100% secure. We do our best, but we're not Fort Knox.

## Kids

This site isn't for kids under 13. We don't knowingly collect data from children. If you're a parent and think your kid signed up for something here, let us know and we'll delete it.

## Changes to This Policy

We might update this policy occasionally:

- When we do, we'll update the "Last Modified" date
- Major changes will be announced
- Continued use = you're okay with the changes

## The Philosophy Behind This

We built this site because we wanted to share ideas, not harvest data. We're podcasters, not data brokers. Your attention is valuable enoughâ€”we don't need your personal information too.

If you want to support us, listen to the podcast, share it with friends, or buy us a coffee. That's worth more than any data profile ever could be.
