## What Are Cookies (No, Not That Kind)

Cookies are tiny text files that websites store on your device. They're named after fortune cookies, not chocolate chip cookies, which is honestly disappointing.

We wish this was about actual cookies. Those would be way more fun to write about.

## The Cookies We Use (A Shockingly Short List)

### Essential Cookies

These keep the site working:

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Duration | Can You Refuse? |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| `theme` | Remembers if you chose dark mode | 1 year | Technically yes, but then you'll get blinded every visit |
| `consent` | Remembers that you saw this annoying banner | 1 year | Yes, but the banner comes back |

### Analytics Cookies

If we use analytics (like GoatCounter or Plausible):

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Duration | Can You Refuse? |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Usually none | Most privacy-friendly analytics don't use cookies | N/A | N/A |

Why? Because modern analytics can work without cookies. Welcome to the future.

### Newsletter Cookies

If you interact with our newsletter form:

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Duration | Can You Refuse? |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Varies by provider | Prevents duplicate signups | Session | Yes (but your experience suffers) |

### Comment Cookies

If we have comments enabled (Utterances/Giscus):

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Duration | Can You Refuse? |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| GitHub auth tokens | So you don't re-login constantly | Varies | Yes (but you can't comment) |

## What We DON'T Use

- **Advertising cookies** (we're not running ads)
- **Tracking cookies** (we're not Facebook)
- **Third-party marketing cookies** (no thanks)
- **Cross-site tracking** (that's creepy)
- **Fingerprinting** (also creepy)

## How to Manage Cookies

You have options:

### Browser Settings

Every modern browser lets you control cookies:

- **Chrome:** Settings → Privacy → Cookies
- **Firefox:** Settings → Privacy & Security
- **Safari:** Preferences → Privacy
- **Edge:** Settings → Privacy

You can block all cookies, but then websites break. Your choice.

### Browser Extensions

Privacy-focused extensions that actually work:

- **uBlock Origin** (blocks ads and trackers)
- **Privacy Badger** (learns and blocks trackers)
- **Cookie AutoDelete** (nukes cookies when you close tabs)

We use these ourselves. No shame in protecting your privacy.

### Do Not Track

Some browsers have "Do Not Track" settings. Here's the honest truth:

- We honor it (we're not tracking anyway)
- Most sites ignore it (it's not legally binding)
- It's basically useless at this point

Sorry. That's just how it is.

## Cookie Categories (For The EU Folks)

The EU makes us categorize cookies. Fine:

### Strictly Necessary

- Theme preference
- Session management
- Literally anything needed for the site to function

**Legal basis:** Legitimate interest (the site doesn't work without them)

### Functional

- Comment authentication
- Newsletter preferences

**Legal basis:** Your consent (you clicked a button)

### Analytics

- Privacy-friendly visitor counts

**Legal basis:** Legitimate interest (we just want to know if anyone's reading this)

### Marketing/Advertising

- **None. Zero. Zilch.**

**Legal basis:** N/A because we don't do this

## Changes to This Policy

If we start using different cookies:

- We'll update this page
- We'll update the "Last Modified" date
- We might mention it on the podcast

We're not going to email you about cookie policy updates. Nobody wants that.

## The Bottom Line

We use the absolute minimum cookies needed to make this site work and remember your preferences. We're not trying to track you, profile you, or sell you anything.

If you're paranoid (and honestly, in 2025, who can blame you), block all cookies and use RSS. The site will work fine, and we'll never know you were here.
