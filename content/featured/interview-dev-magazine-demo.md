## About This Interview

Dev Magazine reached out to feature me in their monthly "Developer Spotlight" series, where they interview developers, designers, and open source contributors making an impact in the web development community. This written Q&A covers my background, current projects, and perspectives on the evolving landscape of web development.

## Interview Introduction

*Published in Dev Magazine, October 2025 Issue*

In this month's Developer Spotlight, we sit down with a developer who's been making waves in the Hugo community with the Tokyo-Nord theme—a powerful, podcast-focused Hugo theme that's helping content creators build beautiful, performant websites. We discuss the inspiration behind the project, lessons learned, and where web development is headed.

## The Interview

### How did you get started in web development?

My journey started in a pretty unconventional way. I wasn't one of those kids coding at age 10. I actually discovered programming in college through a friend who showed me how to customize our dorm website. I was fascinated by the immediate feedback—write some HTML, refresh the browser, see the changes. That instant gratification hooked me.

I started with WordPress, like many do, but eventually felt limited by the platform. That's when I discovered static site generators. Jekyll first, then Hugo. The speed and flexibility of Hugo blew my mind. Being able to build 10,000-page sites in under a second? That felt like magic.

### What inspired you to create the Tokyo-Nord theme?

I've been podcasting on and off for several years, and every podcast hosting platform or website builder felt... limiting. They were either too simple (just a player and episode list) or too complex (requiring database setup, server management, etc.).

I wanted something in between: beautiful, customizable, fast, and maintainable. Hugo was the perfect foundation, but existing podcast themes were either outdated or missing features I needed. So I built my own.

The "Tokyo" part comes from my love of Japanese design aesthetics—clean, functional, respectful of whitespace. The "Nord" part references the Nord color palette, which I've always found elegant and easy on the eyes.

### What makes Tokyo-Nord different from other podcast themes?

A few things:

**1. Overlay System:** Inspired by Jekyll's Minimal Mistakes theme, I implemented a sophisticated overlay system for featured images. You can display metadata directly on images, add color filters, create gradients—all through simple frontmatter configuration.

**2. Flexibility:** It's not just for podcasts. You can use it for blogs, portfolios, documentation sites. The "podcast" features are optional. If you just want a beautiful Hugo theme with great typography, it works for that too.

**3. Performance:** Every feature is optimized. Lazy loading, asset minification, responsive images, efficient CSS. The theme itself adds minimal overhead to Hugo's already blazing-fast build times.

**4. Documentation:** This might be my proudest achievement. Every feature is documented with examples. I created sample content, wrote guides, and made it as beginner-friendly as possible without sacrificing power-user features.

**5. Accessibility:** From the start, I designed with WCAG guidelines in mind. Semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, keyboard navigation, screen reader support. Everyone should be able to enjoy podcast content.

### What were the biggest challenges in building it?

**Hugo's Learning Curve:** Hugo's templating system is powerful but has a steep learning curve. Understanding the content hierarchy, template lookup order, and partial rendering took time. The documentation is comprehensive but dense.

**Balancing Flexibility and Simplicity:** Every feature adds complexity. I struggled with this constantly. Do I add this option? Will it confuse users? Can I make it optional? Finding the right balance was an ongoing challenge.

**Cross-Platform Testing:** Making sure everything works across browsers, devices, and Hugo versions requires constant testing. Safari has its quirks, Firefox handles CSS differently, mobile browsers have their own challenges.

**Performance vs. Features:** Every cool feature potentially impacts performance. Animations, overlays, embeds—they all add weight. I spent a lot of time optimizing, lazy loading, and making features opt-in rather than default.

**Documentation:** Writing documentation is hard. You know your project intimately, but users don't. Explaining concepts clearly, providing examples, anticipating questions—it's time-consuming but essential.

### What's your development workflow like?

Pretty straightforward:

**Morning:** I start by reviewing issues and pull requests on GitHub. Community feedback is invaluable. Someone always finds edge cases I missed.

**Development:** I work in focused 2-3 hour blocks. I'll pick a feature or bug, implement it, test it, document it. No multitasking. One thing at a time, done right.

**Testing:** I maintain a test site with every possible configuration. Different episode types, various overlay combinations, multiple player embeds. If I change something, I rebuild the entire test site and verify nothing broke.

**Documentation:** For every feature, I write documentation before committing the code. If I can't explain it clearly, maybe it's too complex and needs simplification.

**Version Control:** I use Git branches religiously. Main branch is always stable. Features get their own branches, thoroughly tested before merging.

### What technologies do you use besides Hugo?

The theme itself is pure Hugo—Go templates, SCSS for styling, vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. No build step beyond Hugo's built-in asset pipeline.

**But my workflow includes:**

- **Git/GitHub:** Version control and collaboration
- **VS Code:** My editor of choice, with Hugo-specific extensions
- **Firefox DevTools:** For debugging and performance profiling
- **Lighthouse:** Performance and accessibility auditing
- **BrowserStack:** Cross-browser testing
- **Netlify:** Deployment and preview deployments
- **Plausible Analytics:** Privacy-friendly analytics for the demo site

**I intentionally avoid:**

- **Node.js/npm:** No build system, no dependencies to manage
- **React/Vue/Svelte:** The theme doesn't need a framework
- **jQuery:** Modern browsers make jQuery unnecessary
- **CSS frameworks:** I prefer custom, minimal CSS

### What advice would you give to aspiring web developers?

**1. Start Simple:** Don't try to learn everything at once. Master HTML and CSS first. Really understand the fundamentals. JavaScript comes later.

**2. Build Things:** Tutorials are great, but building projects is how you really learn. Build a portfolio site, then rebuild it better. Build a blog. Build a tool you'd actually use.

**3. Read Documentation:** Get comfortable with technical documentation. It's dense and boring, but it's authoritative. Don't rely only on tutorials.

**4. Use Git from Day One:** Version control is essential. Learn it early, use it always. Future you will be grateful.

**5. Focus on Web Standards:** Frameworks come and go. Web standards endure. Learn how the web actually works: HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript APIs.

**6. Accessibility Matters:** Build for everyone from the start. It's easier than retrofitting accessibility later.

**7. Performance is a Feature:** Fast websites are better websites. Learn to optimize images, minimize requests, use caching effectively.

**8. Join Communities:** Find your people. Hugo Discourse, Dev.to, local meetups. Ask questions, help others, share your work.

**9. Embrace Failure:** Your first projects will be terrible. That's okay! Everyone's were. Keep building, keep learning, keep improving.

**10. Enjoy the Journey:** Web development is frustrating and rewarding in equal measure. Celebrate small wins. Take breaks. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

### Where do you see web development heading in the next few years?

**Continued JAMstack Growth:** Static site generation and serverless functions aren't going away. They're becoming the default for content-driven sites.

**Better Performance Defaults:** Core Web Vitals matter now. Frameworks and tools are prioritizing performance. Expect more automation of optimization.

**AI Assistance:** GitHub Copilot and similar tools are changing how we write code. Not replacing developers, but accelerating repetitive tasks.

**Accessibility Requirements:** More countries are mandating web accessibility. This will push it from "nice to have" to "must have."

**Edge Computing:** Running code closer to users, at the edge, will become more common. Faster response times, better UX.

**Web Components:** Native browser support for reusable components might reduce framework dependence. We'll see.

**Privacy-First:** With increased regulation (GDPR, CCPA), privacy-friendly analytics and reduced tracking will be standard.

**Sustainability:** Energy-efficient websites will matter more. Smaller assets, optimized delivery, green hosting.

### What's next for Tokyo-Nord?

Several features in the pipeline:

- **Multi-language Support:** Full i18n for international podcasters
- **Dark Mode Enhancements:** Better customization options
- **More Player Integrations:** Additional podcast platforms
- **Enhanced Search:** Full-text search with Fuse.js
- **Commenting Systems:** Built-in support for Disqus, Giscus, Utterances
- **Membership Integration:** Support for paid podcast memberships
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Optional stats page for podcast analytics

But honestly, the best features come from user feedback. I build what people actually need, not what I think they might want.

### How can people support your work?

**The best ways:**

1. **Use the theme:** Build something cool with it
2. **Give feedback:** Report bugs, suggest features
3. **Contribute:** Submit PRs, improve documentation
4. **Share:** Tell others about it, write about it
5. **Sponsor:** GitHub Sponsors helps fund development

But really, just using it and sharing your experience is enough. Knowing people find it useful motivates me to keep improving it.
