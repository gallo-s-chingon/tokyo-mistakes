Sooooo this week - we knock on somethings that straight up aren't for everyone. We still talk about the random here and there Videogames like we always do. We even go retro with things, Military Old Skool cool and the other things, but in all reality after that it's a cr*p shoot. We hit a story that has, layers and layers. From Drugs and Sex to cheating to the straight up life style of a Sex Addict. So be forewarned - or you've been forewarned. Oh yeah and the Ask Reddit Questions we answer.
