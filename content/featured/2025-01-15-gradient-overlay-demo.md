This post demonstrates a **gradient overlay** for sophisticated visual effects.

The featured image uses a gradient that fades from dark to transparent:

```yaml
overlay_filter: "linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0,0,0,0.9), rgba(0,0,0,0))"
```

This technique:
- Creates a natural shadow area for text
- Maintains the upper portion of the image visible
- Provides excellent readability for overlaid metadata

Perfect for landscape and nature photography!
