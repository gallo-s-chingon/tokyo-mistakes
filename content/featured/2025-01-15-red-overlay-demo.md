This post demonstrates a **red color overlay** using RGBA format.

The featured image has a semi-transparent red layer applied with:

```yaml
overlay_filter: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)"
```

This creates a warm, vibrant effect perfect for:
- Brand-themed content
- Artistic photography
- Drawing attention to specific posts

You can use any RGB color combination with any alpha transparency value!
