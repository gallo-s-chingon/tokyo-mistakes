I had the honor of appearing on the **Modern Love** podcast with host Anna Martin, where we dove deep into one of the most challenging topics I've ever discussed publicly: finding love again after losing your spouse.

## The Conversation

Anna and I talked about:

### The Grief That Never Fully Goes Away
- How grief changes but doesn't disappear
- The guilt of feeling ready to love again
- Why "moving on" is the wrong phrase entirely

### Relearning How to Date
- The awkwardness of explaining you're a widower on first dates
- How loss changes what you value in relationships
- Why I had to learn to date myself first

### The Unexpected Lessons
- What my late wife taught me about love that I couldn't learn while she was alive
- How trauma can actually make you a better partner (if you do the work)
- The difference between replacing someone and honoring their memory while building something new

## A Particularly Vulnerable Moment

Anna asked me about the first time I said "I love you" to someone after my wife died. I won't spoil it here, but let's just say there were tears - both in the recording and probably in your earbuds when you listen.

## What Surprised Me

The response to this episode was overwhelming. I received hundreds of messages from people who had experienced loss - not just death, but divorce, estrangement, and other forms of relationship endings. 

The common thread? We're all just trying to figure out how to love again without betraying what we've lost.

## Key Quotes

> "Grief doesn't have a timeline, and neither does healing. But somewhere along the way, you realize that your capacity to love didn't die with them - it just got scared and went into hiding."

> "I'm not looking for someone to fill the hole my wife left. I'm looking for someone who understands that hole is part of who I am now, and loves me anyway."

## Listener Reactions

The episode generated more listener mail than any other Modern Love episode that season. Here are some messages that particularly moved me:

**From Sarah in Denver:** *"Your story gave me permission to stop feeling guilty about being ready to date again two years after my divorce. Thank you for showing that healing isn't betrayal."*

**From Marcus in Atlanta:** *"As a fellow widower, hearing you talk about the guilt of happiness hit me right in the chest. I thought I was the only one who felt like I was cheating on her memory by smiling again."*

**From Dr. Jennifer (therapist):** *"I've been working with grief clients for 15 years, and your conversation perfectly captured something I struggle to put into words with my patients. Thank you for the beautiful articulation of complex loss."*

## Behind the Scenes

What you don't hear in the interview:
- We had to take three breaks because I got emotional
- Anna shared her own story of loss off-mic
- The sound engineer (who lost his father recently) joined our conversation afterward
- I almost didn't do the interview because I was worried about being "too real"

## The Ripple Effect

This appearance led to:
- Starting The S Chingon Show podcast
- Speaking at three grief support groups
- Connecting with other widowed content creators
- Meeting someone who became a very important part of my healing journey

*Runtime: 47 minutes*
*Released: January 28, 2024*

## What I Learned

Doing this interview taught me that vulnerability is not weakness - it's connection. Every time I share my story authentically, someone else feels less alone in theirs.

It also reminded me that our stories matter. The messy, complicated, imperfect stories of how we navigate love and loss and everything in between - they matter because they help others feel seen.

## If You're Listening and Relating

If my story resonates with you - whether you've lost through death, divorce, or other circumstances - please know:

1. **Your timeline is your timeline** - don't let anyone rush or shame your healing process
2. **Guilt is normal** - feeling guilty about moving forward doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong
3. **Love isn't finite** - loving again doesn't diminish what you had before
4. **You're not alone** - there's a whole community of us figuring this out together
