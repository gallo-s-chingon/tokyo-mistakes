This is a solo episode - just me, my thoughts, and probably too much coffee. We're talking about something I wish someone had told me years ago: you need to learn how to date yourself before you can successfully date anyone else.

## Why This Episode Exists

I've been getting a lot of DMs from listeners asking about dating after loss, dating after trauma, and dating when you feel "broken." As a jaded widower who's been through the absolute wringer, I wanted to share what I wish I'd known about the relationship you have with yourself.

## What We're Covering Today

### The Uncomfortable Truth About Being Alone

- Why our culture treats being single like a disease to be cured
- The difference between being alone and being lonely
- How I learned to stop seeing solo time as "waiting for someone better"

### Dating Yourself 101

- What it actually means to "date yourself" (it's not just bubble baths)
- The activities that taught me who I am outside of relationships
- Why I take myself on actual dates and don't feel weird about it

### My Journey from Broken to Whole

- The dark period after becoming a widower
- How I accidentally discovered I actually like my own company
- The moment I realized I wasn't "fixing myself" for someone else anymore

### Red Flags in Your Self-Relationship

- Signs you're using relationships to avoid dealing with yourself
- The "savior complex" trap (both giving and receiving)
- Why "you complete me" is actually toxic as hell

## Personal Story Time

Let me tell you about the first time I took myself on a proper date. This was about 18 months after my wife passed, and I was still in that weird space where everything felt foreign.

I dressed up - like, actually put on pants that weren't sweatpants - and took myself to dinner at this nice steakhouse. Brought a book, ordered a good whiskey, and just... existed.

The waiter kept asking if I was waiting for someone. "Nope," I said, "just me tonight." The look of pity on his face was something else.

But here's the thing - it was the first time in months I wasn't anxious, wasn't performing, wasn't trying to be anything other than exactly who I was in that moment. I realized I'd forgotten how to just be with myself without distractions.

## The Activities That Changed Everything

### 1. Solo Travel

Started with day trips, worked up to weekend getaways. When you travel alone, you can't hide behind someone else's preferences. You learn what YOU actually want to do.

### 2. Cooking for One (Well)

Not sad bachelor food - actual good meals. For just me. Because I'm worth the effort.

### 3. Movie Theater Solo Missions

Controversial opinion: movies are better alone. No negotiating what to see, no sharing popcorn, just you and the story.

### 4. The Solo Workshop Adventures

Took classes in things I was curious about but never pursued. Pottery, advanced knitting techniques, even a motorcycle maintenance course. Met interesting people without the pressure of dating.

### 5. Therapy (The Real MVP)

Sometimes dating yourself means getting professional help to understand why you do what you do.

## What I Learned About Myself

- I actually like quiet mornings more than busy ones
- I'm funnier when I'm not trying to impress anyone
- My taste in everything (food, movies, music) had been influenced by others for so long I'd forgotten my own preferences
- I'm comfortable with deeper conversations than I realized
- I genuinely enjoy my own company (who knew?)

## The Relationship Benefits

When you're genuinely okay being alone:

- You stop settling for relationships that drain you
- You bring your whole self to partnerships instead of half a person looking for completion
- Conflict doesn't feel like the end of the world
- You can give space without it feeling like abandonment
- You're more attractive because desperation is the opposite of sexy

## Solo Activities I Recommend

### Low-Key Options

- Coffee shop mornings with a good book
- Solo hikes or walks
- Cooking projects that take time
- Museum visits at your own pace
- Concerts or shows (surprisingly great alone)

### Adventure Level

- Weekend trips to new cities
- Taking classes in something you're curious about
- Volunteering for causes you care about
- Trying restaurants you've always wanted to visit
- Solo camping (if you're into that level of self-reliance)

## The Hard Truths

### It's Not Always Fun

Some days, being alone sucks. Holidays are weird. Couple friends sometimes don't know what to do with you. You'll have moments of profound loneliness.

### People Will Project Their Fears

Others will assume you're lonely, desperate, or "giving up." They'll try to fix you with blind dates and unsolicited advice. Learn to smile and redirect.

### You Might Like It Too Much

Real talk: I got so comfortable being alone that dating again felt like a huge disruption. There's a balance between self-sufficiency and openness to partnership.

## For My Fellow Loss Survivors

If you're here because you've lost someone important - through death, divorce, or life circumstances - this isn't about "moving on" or "getting back out there." This is about remembering that you're a complete person worthy of your own time and attention.

You don't need to fix yourself for someone else. You're not broken. You're just learning how to be whole in a different way.

## The Bottom Line

Dating yourself isn't selfish - it's essential. How can you expect someone else to love and respect you if you don't? How can you communicate your needs if you don't know what they are?

The goal isn't to become so independent that you don't need anyone. It's to become so comfortable with yourself that you can choose partnerships from a place of want rather than need.

## Listener Challenge

This week, take yourself on one solo date. Doesn't have to be fancy - could be a solo lunch, a movie, a walk through a part of town you've never explored.

Pay attention to:

- How it feels to make decisions without consulting anyone
- What you notice when you're not trying to entertain someone else
- Whether you enjoy your own company or if it feels uncomfortable (both are valuable data)

Share your solo adventures with me on social media - I love seeing what people discover about themselves.

## Next Week

Episode 006 is dropping with certified sex educator Luna Martinez, and we're diving into "Consent Culture Beyond the Bedroom" - how the principles of enthusiastic consent can transform all your relationships, not just the sexy ones.
