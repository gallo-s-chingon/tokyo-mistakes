Let me start with a confession: I've spent more money on mechanical keyboards than most people spend on their cars. And you know what? I regret absolutely nothing.

## The Rabbit Hole

It started innocently enough. I was tired of the mushy membrane keyboard that came with my setup. "I'll just get something basic," I told myself. Famous last words.

Three dozen keebs (keyboards), five dozen switches, and one very understanding bank account later, I'm here to tell you why this "expensive hobby" is actually one of the best investments in your mental health.

## The Therapy of Building

There's something deeply satisfying about:

- **Research Phase**: Diving into switch comparisons, reading endless forum posts about actuation force
- **Planning**: Choosing the perfect case, PCB, and plate combination
- **Building**: The meditative process of lubing switches and assembling your creation
- **Typing**: That first keystroke on your custom creation

## Why It's Not Just About the Keyboard

### 1. Mindfulness in Action

When you're lubing 40 plus switches, you're forced to be present. No scrolling, no multitasking - just you, the switch, and the perfect amount of Krytox 205g0.

### 2. Problem-Solving Skills

Plate flex, case foam, switch films - every build presents unique challenges that require creative solutions.

### 3. Community Connection

The mechanical keyboard community is surprisingly wholesome. We're all just nerds who appreciate good engineering and satisfying (or sometimes silent) clicks.

## The Real Cost Analysis

Let's be honest about the money:

- **Entry Level**: $150-300 for a decent first build
- **Enthusiast**: $300-600 for solid materials and switches
- **Endgame**: $600+ for artisan keycaps and limited edition cases

But consider this: How much do you spend on things that provide temporary happiness? That daily coffee runs $1,500/year. This hobby gives you daily satisfaction every time you sit at your desk.

## My Current Setup

Currently typing this on my latest build:

- **Case**: custom CNC milled anodized purple aluminum
- **Keyboard**: Corne MX V3
- **Switches**: Gazzew's Bobagum Silent Linear switches (lubed with 205g0)
- **Keycaps**: GMK Dots
- **Total Cost**: $487
- **Daily Joy**: Priceless

## The Unexpected Life Lesson

Building keyboards taught me something important: perfectionism has its place, but so does "good enough." My first build had uneven stabilizers and inconsistent lubing. It wasn't perfect, but it was mine.

That lesson applies to everything - relationships, career, life choices. Sometimes "good enough" is exactly what you need to move forward.

## To Those Considering the Jump

If you're thinking about getting into mechanical keyboards:

1. **Start modest** - Don't go straight to endgame (there's never and endgame)
2. **Join the community** - r/mechanicalkeyboards is surprisingly helpful
3. **Budget accordingly** - This hobby has no ceiling
4. **Enjoy the process** - The build is half the experience

And to those who think we're crazy? You're probably right. But we're happily crazy, typing away on our $400 happiness machines.

_Currently typing this at 75 WPM with zero typos because these Bobagums are just that smooth._
